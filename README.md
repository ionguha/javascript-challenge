### The Truth is Out There: Searching through UFO sightings
_"Wake Up Sheeple"_ my boss muttered under his breath as he scanned through the hundreds of eye-witness reports of UFO sightings. _"Well, the extra terrestial menace has come to earth.. how do we inform the ignorant masses ?"_ he looked at me questioningly. We are on the 13th floor of **"Aliens-R-Real"** rummaging through the records of alien sightings reported from various locations. _"The collection is too large to search manually"_ I said hoping for an early lunch break. _"That's why I brought you here"_ my boss said with a sly look _"you need to write code using **JavaScript, HTML, CSS** and **D3.js** so that our faithful followers can **mine through the data, create table dynamically from the data** and **filter** the table data for specific values"_. With a rumbling stomach, I said with a forceful smile: _"I can handle this..but first i need to try out our lunch special in the canteen..UFO burger with green onions"._
### Project: Wake Up Sheeple
In this assignment, I used JavaScript, HTML, CSS and D3.js to create table dynamically from a dataset where a curious user can search and filter the data for specific parameters
### UFO-level-1
* A HTML webpage that displays a table created from the dataset (data.js) and appends new rows of data for each UFO sighting
* The date form (with form field validation) is used to listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find the rows that match user input.
